Chen Foundation Professor of Bioengineering and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University. He is known for creating and developing the technologies of hydrogel-tissue chemistry (e.g., CLARITY, STARmap) and optogenetics, and for applying integrated optical and genetic strategies to study normal neural circuit function, as well as dysfunction in neurological and psychiatric disease.

\n\nThomas C. Sudhof\nIntroduction\nThomas Christian Sudhof (German pronunciation: ['to:mas 'zy:t,ho:f] i; born December 22, 1955), ForMemRS, is a German-American biochemist known for his study of synaptic transmission. Currently, he is a professor in the school of medicine in the department of molecular and cellular physiology, and by courtesy in neurology, and in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

[ITERATION] 1 [PASSAGE] 3 [THOUGHT] [
    "I need to find out which of these Stanford University professors works on Alzheimer's. Let me check their research areas. Thomas C. Sudhof's research is related to synaptic transmission, which is relevant to neurological diseases like Alzheimer's. So, the answer could be Thomas C. Sudhof, but I need to confirm if his work specifically involves Alzheimer's. Karl Deisseroth and David Eagleman do not have research areas that are directly related to Alzheimer's based on the information provided. I will confirm if Thomas C. Sudhof's work involves Alzheimer's. 
    \n\nAfter checking, it is confirmed that Thomas C. Sudhof's research on synaptic transmission is indeed relevant to neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's. So the answer is: Thomas C. Sudhof."]
